Problem Statement â€“ 
This NIH Chest X-ray Dataset is comprised of 112,120 X-ray images with disease labels from 30,805 unique patients. 
To create these labels, the authors used Natural Language Processing to text-mine disease classifications from the 
associated radiological reports. There are 15 classes (14 diseases, and one for "No findings"). 
Challenge is to built a deep learning model to label Images as
"No findings" or one or more disease classes: 
[Atelectasis, Consolidation, Infiltration, Pneumothorax, Edema, Emphysema, Fibrosis, Effusion, Pneumonia, 
Pleural_thickening, Cardiomegaly, Nodule, Mass, Hern].

I used Fast AI computer vision library to develop the solution and achieved an AUC of 82%
